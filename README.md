## Overview

This repository contains the code for implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to understand the fundamental components of a CNN and gain insights into the process of training a deep learning model for image classification.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the CNN, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cnn-from-scratch.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd cnn-from-scratch
   ```

3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This script includes an example of loading the dataset, training the CNN, and evaluating its performance.
